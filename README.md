# Biofeedback-therapist-application
This project is the application for biofeedback therapy. 
The whole project consists of Raspberry Pi server application(wrote in python by my colleague), Arduino robot, this application and MindWave Mobile2.
Interface design is easy to use, there is only few buttons for therapist just to control connections with robot, 
thinkgear and therapist toy(in this case this is robot)
This application is for data visualisation from headset and raspberry pi sensors(at this moment there is only pulse sensor working) 
and also for controlling the robot speed that bundles whith patient "Attention Value"
